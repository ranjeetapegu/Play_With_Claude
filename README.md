# ðŸ§ª Playing with Anthropic Claude Models

This repository contains Python notebooks and scripts for experimenting with [Anthropic's Claude models](https://www.anthropic.com/claude).  
The goal is to explore prompt engineering, multi-turn conversations, structured data handling, and integration into Python applications.

- Work with **Claude 3** family: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus.
- Prompt engineering for:
  - Q&A and reasoning tasks
  - Summarization
  - Code generation
  - Data transformation
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks for live experimentation.
